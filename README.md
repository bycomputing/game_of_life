# game_of_life

The Game of Life, invented by Cambridge mathematician John H. Conway, is a 
"cellular automaton" supposed to model the genetic laws for birth, survival and death. It became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by 
Scientific American in 1970.

The Game of Life is a no-player game. One interacts with it by seeding it and 
observing how it evolves.

The game requires Java to run. Go to https://java.com/en/download/ to download

which can be downloaded from
